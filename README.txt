Design and Development Process
        To design and develop this website, the team first assembled our brand identity, involving the common colors and fonts we would use throughout the duration of the project. After our brand identity was created, the team split and worked on separate scopes of the work with Brady designing the logo whilst Chance set the framework for which both members would use to establish common variables that would be heavily relied upon later. As completion of the framework and logo neared completion, the sitemap and wireframe were the next point of focus of the work. 
The wireframe acted more as a mockup for the website and took a large chunk of time to complete, but paid off by being heavily important in the HTML/CSS design portion of the project and was a critical investment to the success of the subsequent rest of the project. The largest amount of time was spent coding the entirety of the website as problems were frequent and not far between; using a vast chunk of time to fix said problems.
Whilst the resources used for the coding side of things were simple, being that of Visual Studio Code and Gitbash for file sharing, the design process was more tool intensive and required the use of Figma for wireframe and sitemap production, Adobe Illustrator for the creation of vector-based images and icons, and Photoshop for the assembly and editing of images.
A large issue with testing came from most of the production being based on a live server, and when porting such content over to a file-based local server it yielded primarily link issues for images and pages that required much testing and fixing. Mobile compatability was a large issue, but was able to be achieved in the end to a working state.
This project mirrors the values of SkillsUSA and the client's work order by following to the dot appropriate and professional content whilst retaining the style that the client had established prior to being replicated in website form. This website holds much of the style that was requested, being that it is an eco-friendly commercial website set on being friendly to the environment whilst also attempting to sell a product which is reflected by the use of eco-friendly colors and commercial incentives.
